# Roadmap

This is a roadmap specifically for goals for the Three.js boilerplate code in this branch of the repository. Since the example is a literal "hello world", the logical end result will be a goal of "tour of the solar system". Reasoning:
- Should be easy to get assets
- Would fit nicely as an educational app
- Could be an easy jump into something more complex, like a space based RTS game
- Will allow for easy experimentation for what works and best practices
- Much of the data and other requirements can be gathered from real life
